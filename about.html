		<p><b>Francesca Bellettini (born 18 April 1970) is an Italian business woman. She has been the chief executive officer of Yves Saint Laurent since 2013. Due to the extraordinary growth of the company under her leadership, she has been named by the Financial Times as one of the 25 most influential women of 2022.She joined the famous Parisian house, replacing Paul Deneuve, at a crucial time in its development. At the time Pinault, chairman of parent company Kering, was open about his wish that the house reach $1 billion dollars in sales and Bellettini played an integral role in achieving that goal. Bellettini holds a degree from Bocconi University in Milan and began her career as an investment banker in London, working for Goldman Sachs, Compass Partners and others. In 2019 she was awarded the French Knight of the Legion of Honour, the highest possible distinction for a civilian in the country.</b></p>
